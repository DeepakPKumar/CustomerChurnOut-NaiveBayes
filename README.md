# CustomerChurnOut-NaiveBayes
This is a Marketing analytics case study where we are predicting customer churn out from Auto Insurance company data. I have worked through 3 different algorithms Logistic Regression, Kernel SVM & Naive Bayes. I will be validating all three algorithms to ensure we choose the right algorithm to prepare a model and take it further accordingly.

Thanks.
